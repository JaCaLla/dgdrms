## IDE

* XCode 9.2 

## Libraries used (Podfile)

* **Alamofire**. This pod is being used for encapsuling network requests
* **SwiftLint**. This pod performs an static code analysis, depending on the issue found injects a warning or even a compilation failure. This is very usefull to reduce dramatically SONAR isses [link](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)
* **R.Swift**. This pod pregenerates codes that generate structure with your resources (texts, images, reuse identifiers...) . So next time that you compile a project with a missing resource (or reuse identifier identifier) it will be detected at compilation time, not running the app in the device (or simulator, ...or even worst in front of final user).[link](https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift)
